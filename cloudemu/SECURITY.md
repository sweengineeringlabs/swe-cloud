1. **Email**: [security-report@example.com]
2. **Private Disclosure**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature if enabled.

Please provide a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution.
