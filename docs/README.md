# SWE Cloud Documentation

**Audience**: Architects, Developers, DevOps Engineers

## WHAT: Multi-Cloud Development Platform

SWE Cloud is a unified workspace providing cloud emulation (CloudEmu), a multi-cloud SDK (CloudKit), and infrastructure-as-code (IAC) built on the SEA architecture pattern.

## WHY: Unified Cloud Development

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Cloud bills during development | CloudEmu local emulation |
| Provider lock-in | CloudKit multi-cloud SDK |
| Infrastructure drift | IAC Terraform facades |
| Slow deployment loops | Instant local testing |
