## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously across all SWE Cloud sub-projects (CloudEmu, CloudKit, IAC).

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead:

1. **Email**: security-report@example.com
2. **Private Disclosure**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected sub-project(s)
- Potential impact

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution.

**Note**: CloudEmu is a development tool intended for local use. Do not expose CloudEmu endpoints to the public internet.
